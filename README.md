## Getting Started
For those who are totally brand new to Python (like me).

##### 2. Requires python-requests. Install with pip:
```$ pip install requests``` or ```$ easy_install requests```

##### 3. Fork this repository by clicking "fork" in the top-right corner of the page.

##### 4. Set up Git and make sure you have set up authentication to Github.

##### 6. In either the clone with HTTP or SSH section, click the copy icon to copy the clone URL for the repository. 

##### 7. In terminal, type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of YOUR-USERNAME:
```$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/gdax-api-tester-python```

##### 8. Open up the repository in terminal and create a config.py file:
```$ touch config.py```

##### 9. Go to https://www.gdax.com/settings/api, select all the permissions, and create an API Key.

##### 9. Open the config.py in your text editor, and include your API Key, API Secret, and Passphase under:
